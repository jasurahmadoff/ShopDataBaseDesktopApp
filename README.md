#ShopDataBaseDesktopApp

This project can perform all operations related to e-shop. In order to access the shop database, you must first register as an administrator or employee. You can log in to your account after entering your username and password correctly. In your account you can see the stock of the chain of the shops, names of branches, names of products in each branch, specialties of employees, general information about the employees and customers, provider companies and finally the sales schedule. You can also add, edit, delete, and search for each item within the project. If you don't know Azerbaijani, you can also use the English language feature at the top of the screen.
