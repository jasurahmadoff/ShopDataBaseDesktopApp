#ShopDataBaseDesktopApp

This project is able to do all the work related to e-shop operations. In order to access the database, 
you must first register as an administrator or employee. You can log in to your account after entering your username and password correctly. 
In your account you can see the stock of the chain of stores, the names of the branches, the names of the products in each branch, the specialties of the employees, 
general information about the employees and customers, provider companies and finally the sales schedule.
You can also add, edit, delete, and search for each of the items. If you don't know Azerbaijani, you can also use the English language feature within the project.
